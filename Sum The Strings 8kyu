Create a function that takes 2 nonnegative integers in form of a string as an input, and outputs the sum (also as a string):

Example: (Input1, Input2 -->Output)

"4",  "5" --> "9"
"34", "5" --> "39"
Notes:

If either input is an empty string, consider it as zero.

Inputs and the expected output will never exceed the signed 32-bit integer limit (2^31 - 1)

Solutions
function sumStr(a,b) {
  return String(Number(a)+Number(b));
}
